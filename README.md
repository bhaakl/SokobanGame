# Sokoban Game
Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. This is my implementation (there is still work to be done to improve it) of this game for Android platforms, which consists of several levels in which the player needs to drag boxes to a target.
